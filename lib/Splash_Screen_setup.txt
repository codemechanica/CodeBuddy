Ensure that assets are there!!

command to create the splash file
run it everytime u change the flutter_splash_native parameters such as logo, background, color, etc..

> dart run flutter_native_splash:create

To remove splash screen and go to default flutter_screen 

> dart run flutter_native_splash:remove

if u wish to have a plain color in the background of splash.

comment the background_image: parameter and uncomment the color parameter above it with the desired color
Same should be copied to android 12 parameters
Different assets can be used for dark-mode too, if not defined then it will be same as above parameter

for ios Different assets could be used too
